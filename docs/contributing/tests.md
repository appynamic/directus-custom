# Tests

> Tests ensure that the platform continues to work as intended when the existing codebase is modified.

The current test strategy for Directus consists of `Blackbox Tests` testing the overall functionality of the platform as well as `Unit Tests` testing individual parts of the codebase.

## Running Tests

### Running Unit Tests

Use the following command to perform unit tests in all packages:
```bash
pnpm --workspace-root test
```

Use one of the following commands to perform more specific actions with unit tests (mix and match as desired):

```bash
# Run tests for a specific package (for example only in the API / App package)
pnpm --filter api test
pnpm --filter app test

# Start tests in watch mode
pnpm --filter api test -- --watch

# Enable coverage report
pnpm --filter api test -- --coverage

# Run specific test files using a filter pattern
pnpm --filter api test -- app.test.ts
pnpm --filter api test -- utils
```

:::tip Relative Commands

If you are already in a directory of a specific package, you may omit the `--filter` flag in `pnpm` commands since the commands will be executed relative to the current directory.

```bash
# Run API tests, from within the "/api" directory
pnpm test
```

### Running Blackbox Tests

Install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and ensure that the service is up and running.

Run the following commands to start the blackbox tests:

```bash
# Ensure that you are testing against the lastest state of the codebase
pnpm --workspace-root build

# Clean up in case you ran the tests before
pnpm --filter tests-blackbox exec docker compose down --volumes
# Start the containers required for the tests
pnpm --filter tests-blackbox exec docker compose up --detach --wait

# Run the tests
pnpm --workspace-root test:blackbox
```

Subsequent test runs can be issued with the following command, if only modifications to the blackbox tests themselves have been made:

```bash
pnpm --filter tests-blackbox test
```

#### Testing Specific Database Vendors

Provide a CSV of database vendors via the `TEST_DB` environment variable to target only a specific subset:

```bash
# Example targeting multiple vendors
TEST_DB=cockroachdb,postgres pnpm --workspace-root test:blackbox

# Example targeting a single vendor
TEST_DB=sqlite3 pnpm --workspace-root test:blackbox
```

#### Using an Existing Directus Instance

Normally, the test suite will spin up a fresh copy of the Directus API built from the current state of the codebase. To use
an already running instance of Directus instead, enable the `TEST_LOCAL` flag:

```bash
TEST_DB=cockroachdb TEST_LOCAL=true pnpm --workspace-root test:blackbox
```

Note: The tests expect the instance running at `localhost:8055`. Make sure to connect the instance to the test database
container found in the `tests-blackbox/docker-compose.yml` file.
